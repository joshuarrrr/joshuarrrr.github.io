This year I'm living in Ann Arbor, MI, because my wife was selected for the prestigious [Knight-Wallace Fellowship](http://wallacehouse.umich.edu/knight-wallace/our-fellows/) at the University of Michigan.

One of the best perks of the fellowhip is that spouses are welcomed and included in almost all the fellowship activities, which include fascinating seminars and events and international travel. In addition, we're able to audit any class at the university.

Location was the primary factor we considered when choosing where to live in Ann Arbor. We live on the "Old West Side", a residential neighborhood that is still easily walkable to downtown, campus, and Wallace House. Below are our typical walking routes.
