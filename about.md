This site was built for [Introduction to Digital Humanities](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-methods/index.html), a Winter 2017 class at the University of Michigan taught by Fred Gibbs. Part of the class involves building personal portfolio sites with Jekyll as a way to teach basic development proactices and tools including text editors, the command line, git, GitHub, and static site generation.

When I first setup my [real portfolio site](http://joshromero.com), I looked at and considered Jekyll and a number of different static site generators, but eventually settled on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), because I was most comfortable writing javascript at that time.
